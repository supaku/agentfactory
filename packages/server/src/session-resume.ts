/**
 * Session Resume — REN-1398 (Decision 4)
 *
 * Reads journal entries (REN-1397) for a session and computes the
 * "resume marker" — the latest checkpointed step.  Workers consult
 * this on start-up: any step whose journal entry already shows
 * `completed` is skipped on replay; the next step that should run is
 * whichever the workflow's step graph identifies as immediately after
 * the checkpoint.
 *
 * Architecture references:
 *   - rensei-architecture/ADR-2026-04-29-long-running-runtime-substrate.md
 *     (commit 56f2bc6) — Decision 4 (Resume).
 *   - REN-1397 — `listSessionJournal(sessionId)` is the consumed API.
 *
 * Design contract:
 *   - The resume marker is purely the journal-derived view; the
 *     workflow engine is responsible for translating "after step X"
 *     into the next concrete step id.  This module exposes the journal
 *     observation only — it does NOT walk the workflow graph.
 *   - `running` entries are treated as in-flight: the worker that
 *     restarts will either (a) re-claim the session and continue, or
 *     (b) the session FSM's reassignment path (existing) re-routes it.
 *     We DO surface `running` steps in the resume payload so callers
 *     can decide.
