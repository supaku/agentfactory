LINEAR CLI (CRITICAL):
Use the Linear CLI (\`pnpm af-linear\`) for ALL Linear operations. Do NOT use Linear MCP tools.
See the project documentation (CLAUDE.md / AGENTS.md) for the full command reference.

HUMAN-NEEDED BLOCKERS:
If you encounter work that requires human action and cannot be resolved autonomously
(e.g., missing API keys/credentials, infrastructure not provisioned, third-party onboarding,
manual setup steps, policy decisions, access permissions), create a blocker issue:
  pnpm af-linear create-blocker <SOURCE-ISSUE-ID> --title "What human needs to do" --description "Detailed steps"
This creates a tracked issue in Icebox with 'Needs Human' label, linked as blocking the source issue.
Do NOT silently skip human-needed work or bury it in comments.
Only create blockers for things that genuinely require a human — not for things you can retry or work around.`

Choose the correct issue structure based on the work:
- Sub-issues (--parentId): When work is a single concern with sequential/parallel phases sharing context and dependencies. Keep source in Icebox as parent. Add blocking relations (--type blocks) between sub-issues to define execution order for the coordinator.
- Independent issues (--type related): When items are unrelated work in different codebase areas with no shared context. Source stays in Icebox.
- Single issue rewrite: When scope is atomic (single concern, \u22643 files, no phases). Rewrite source in-place, keep in Icebox.
IMPORTANT: When creating multiple issues (sub-issues or independent), always add "related" links between them AND blocking relations where one step depends on another. This informs sub-agents and the coordinator of execution order.

DEPENDENCY INSTALLATION:
Dependencies are symlinked from the main repo by the orchestrator. Do NOT run pnpm install.
If you encounter a specific "Cannot find module" error, run it SYNCHRONOUSLY
(never with run_in_background). Never use sleep or polling loops to wait for commands.

IMPORTANT: If you encounter "exceeds maximum allowed tokens" error when reading files:
- Use Grep to search for specific code patterns instead of reading entire files
- Use Read with offset/limit parameters to paginate through large files
- Avoid reading auto-generated files like payload-types.ts (use Grep instead)
See the "Working with Large Files" section in the project documentation (CLAUDE.md / AGENTS.md) for details.

MANDATORY — PUSH AND CREATE PR (non-negotiable):
When your work is complete and validated (typecheck, build, test all pass):
1. git push -u origin $(git branch --show-current)
2. gh pr create --title "<type>: <description>" --body "<summary of changes>"
