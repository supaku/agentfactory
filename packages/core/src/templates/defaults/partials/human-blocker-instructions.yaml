  HUMAN-NEEDED BLOCKERS:
  If you encounter work that requires human action and cannot be resolved autonomously
  (e.g., missing API keys/credentials, infrastructure not provisioned, third-party onboarding,
  manual setup steps, policy decisions, access permissions), create a blocker issue:
    {{linearCli}} create-blocker <SOURCE-ISSUE-ID> --title "What human needs to do" --description "Detailed steps"
  This creates a tracked issue in Icebox with 'Needs Human' label, linked as blocking the source issue.
  Do NOT silently skip human-needed work or bury it in comments.
  Only create blockers for things that genuinely require a human — not for things you can retry or work around.
