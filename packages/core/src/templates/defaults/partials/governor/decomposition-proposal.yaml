  ## Decomposition Proposed

  This issue has failed QA {{cycleCount}} times. The system is preparing to decompose it.

  **Proposed approach:** Break into independently testable sub-issues based on failure patterns.

  {{#if totalCostUsd}}
  **Cost so far:** ${{totalCostUsd}}
  {{/if}}

  - Comment "HOLD" to review before decomposition
  - Do nothing — system will decompose automatically
