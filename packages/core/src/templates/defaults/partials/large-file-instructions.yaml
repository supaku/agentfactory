  IMPORTANT: If you encounter "exceeds maximum allowed tokens" error when reading files:
  - Use Grep to search for specific code patterns instead of reading entire files
  - Use Read with offset/limit parameters to paginate through large files
  - Avoid reading auto-generated files like payload-types.ts (use Grep instead)
  See the "Working with Large Files" section in the project documentation (CLAUDE.md / AGENTS.md) for details.
