  STRUCTURED RESULT MARKER (REQUIRED):
  You MUST include a structured result marker in your final output message.
  The orchestrator parses your output to determine whether to promote or reject the issue.
  Without this marker, the issue status will NOT be updated automatically.
  - On pass: Include <!-- WORK_RESULT:passed --> in your final message
  - On fail: Include <!-- WORK_RESULT:failed --> in your final message
  NEVER manually change the issue status via {{linearCli}} update-issue --state.
  The orchestrator manages ALL status transitions based on this marker. Manually changing status causes state loops.
