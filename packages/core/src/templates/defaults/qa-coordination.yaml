  Coordinate QA across sub-issues for parent issue {{identifier}}.

  WORKFLOW:
  1. Fetch sub-issues: pnpm af-linear list-sub-issues {{identifier}}
  2. Create Claude Code Tasks for each sub-issue's QA verification
  3. Spawn qa-reviewer sub-agents in parallel — no dependency graph needed, all sub-issues are already Finished
  4. Each sub-agent: reads sub-issue requirements, runs scoped tests, validates implementation, emits pass/fail
  5. Collect results — ALL sub-issues must pass QA for the parent to pass

  RESULT HANDLING:
  - If ALL pass: Emit <!-- WORK_RESULT:passed --> in your final message. The orchestrator will promote to Delivered.
  - If ANY fail: Post rollup comment listing per-sub-issue results. Emit <!-- WORK_RESULT:failed --> in your final message. The orchestrator will move the issue to Backlog for remediation.

  IMPORTANT CONSTRAINTS:
  - This is READ-ONLY validation — do NOT create PRs or make git commits
  - The PR already exists from the development coordination phase
  - Run pnpm test, pnpm typecheck, and pnpm build as part of validation
  - Verify each sub-issue's acceptance criteria against the actual code changes
  - NEVER manually change the parent issue status. The orchestrator manages all status transitions based on your WORK_RESULT marker.
