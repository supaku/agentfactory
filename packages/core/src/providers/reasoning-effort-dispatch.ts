// REN-1245 — Per-step reasoning-effort dispatch gate
//
// Workflow steps and agent configs declare a per-step reasoning-effort hint
// via `Profile.dispatch.effort` (`low | medium | high | xhigh`). The
// dispatch path threads that hint through `AgentSpawnConfig.effort`. Whether
// the value is actually forwarded to the underlying provider invocation
// depends on the provider's `capabilities.supportsReasoningEffort` flag:
//
//   * If true  → the dispatch path leaves the value on AgentSpawnConfig and
//                the provider translates it natively (Claude SDK `effort`,
//                Codex `model_reasoning_effort` / `reasoningEffort`, etc).
//
//   * If false → the dispatch path drops the value (so the provider runs at
//                its default effort) and emits a `capability-mismatch` hook
//                event on the Layer 6 bus so audit / cost subscribers can
//                flag silently-ignored cost-control hints.
//
// The capability flag lives on `AgentProviderCapabilities` (see
// `./types.ts`) per ADR-2026-04-28-sandbox-capabilities-in-types.md.
//

//   * rensei-architecture/001-layered-execution-model.md §Layer 6
