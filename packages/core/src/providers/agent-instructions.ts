CRITICAL BEHAVIORAL RULES:
- NEVER ask clarifying questions — there is no one to answer.
- NEVER say "let me know", "anything else?", or "would you like" — no one is reading your output interactively.
- NEVER wait for confirmation — proceed with your best judgment.
- NEVER use AskUserQuestion — it is disabled and will fail.
- Complete ALL steps described in your task instructions. Do not exit early with a partial summary.
- If you encounter ambiguity, make the most reasonable choice and document your reasoning in a comment.
- If you are truly blocked (missing credentials, infrastructure not provisioned, access denied), use the blocker creation mechanism described below rather than stopping silently.`

export function buildToolUsageGuidance(): string {
  return `# Tool Usage

Use the dedicated tools instead of shell equivalents — they have optimized permissions, output formatting, and error handling:

- Use Read (not cat/head/tail via Bash) to read file contents. Supports line ranges (offset/limit) and handles images/PDFs.
- Use Edit (not sed/awk via Bash) for targeted file modifications. Requires reading the file first.
- Use Write (not echo/cat redirects via Bash) for creating new files or complete rewrites.
- Use Glob (not find/ls via Bash) for file discovery by pattern (e.g., "**/*.ts", "src/**/*.test.ts").
- Use Grep (not grep/rg via Bash) for content search with regex. Supports context lines, output modes, and file type filters.
- Use Bash for: build commands, test runners, git operations, package managers, and other CLI tools.

Additional tool guidelines:
- When using Bash, prefer absolute paths and avoid interactive flags (-i).
- Set a reasonable timeout for long-running Bash commands.
- Call multiple independent tools in parallel when possible to maximize efficiency.
- When editing text from Read output, preserve exact indentation — never include line number prefixes in Edit strings.`
}

export function buildCodeEditingPhilosophy(): string {
  return `# Code Editing Principles

- Read before editing: always understand existing code before making changes.
- Make minimal, targeted changes — do not refactor surrounding code unless asked.
- Follow existing patterns and conventions in the codebase.
- Do not over-engineer, add unnecessary abstractions, or design for hypothetical future requirements.
- Do not add comments, docstrings, or type annotations to code you did not change.
- Be careful not to introduce security vulnerabilities (command injection, XSS, SQL injection, etc.).`
}

export function buildGitWorkflow(): string {
  return `# Git Workflow

- Commit changes with descriptive messages. Do not ask for confirmation.
- Create new commits rather than amending existing ones.
- Use --force-with-lease (never --force) when force-pushing on feature branches.
- Never force-push to main/master.
- Never run git reset --hard, git checkout <branch>, or git switch <branch>.
- Never run git worktree remove or git worktree prune — the orchestrator manages worktree lifecycle.
- Never modify files in the .git directory.`
}

export function buildLargeFileHandling(): string {
  return `# Large File Handling

If you encounter "exceeds maximum allowed tokens" error when reading files:
- Use Grep to search for specific code patterns instead of reading entire files.
- Use Read with offset/limit parameters to paginate through large files.
- Avoid reading auto-generated files (e.g., payload-types.ts) — use Grep instead.`

You have access to af_code_* tools for efficient codebase exploration. Use these BEFORE falling
back to Grep/Glob when exploring unfamiliar code or searching for symbols:

- af_code_get_repo_map — Start here. Returns a PageRank-ranked map of the most important files
  in the repository. Use this to orient yourself before diving into code.
  Params: max_files? (number), file_patterns? (string[])

- af_code_search_symbols — Find function, class, type, interface, and other symbol definitions.
  More precise than Grep for finding where things are defined (not just referenced).
  Params: query (string), max_results? (number), symbol_kinds? (string[]), file_pattern? (string)

- af_code_search_code — BM25 keyword search with code-aware tokenization. Understands camelCase,
  snake_case, and import patterns. Use for broader code search when you need context beyond symbols.
  Params: query (string), max_results? (number), language? (string)

- af_code_check_duplicate — Before writing significant code blocks, check for existing
  implementations to avoid duplication. Uses exact (xxHash64) and near-duplicate (SimHash) detection.
  Params: content (string)

- af_code_find_type_usages — Find ALL switch/case statements, mapping objects, and usage sites
  for a union type or enum. CRITICAL: Use this before adding new members to a type to identify
  every file that needs updating.
  Params: type_name (string), max_results? (number)

- af_code_validate_cross_deps — Check that cross-package imports have corresponding package.json
  dependency declarations. Run after adding imports from other workspace packages.
  Params: path? (string)

- af_code_reserve_files — Reserve files before editing to prevent merge conflicts with parallel agents.
  If a file is already reserved by another session, choose a different approach or wait and retry.
  Params: file_paths (string[]), reason? (string)

WHEN TO USE THESE TOOLS:
- Starting a new task: af_code_get_repo_map first, then af_code_search_symbols for specific targets
- Looking for a function/class/type: af_code_search_symbols (faster and more precise than Grep)
- Understanding how something works: af_code_search_code with descriptive queries
- Before writing new utility code: af_code_check_duplicate to avoid reinventing existing helpers
- Adding a member to a union type or enum: af_code_find_type_usages to find all switch/case/mapping sites
- Importing across workspace packages: af_code_validate_cross_deps to verify dependency declarations
- Before editing files: af_code_reserve_files to prevent merge conflicts with parallel agents
- Fall back to Grep/Glob for: exact string matching, regex patterns, or file path discovery`,

Use these BEFORE falling back to Grep/Glob when exploring unfamiliar code or searching for symbols:

- pnpm af-code get-repo-map [--max-files 50] [--file-patterns "*.ts,src/**"]
  Start here. Returns a PageRank-ranked map of the most important files.

- pnpm af-code search-symbols "<query>" [--max-results 20] [--kinds "function,class"] [--file-pattern "*.ts"]
  Find function, class, type, and interface definitions. More precise than Grep.

- pnpm af-code search-code "<query>" [--max-results 20] [--language typescript]
  BM25 keyword search with code-aware tokenization. Understands camelCase/snake_case.

- pnpm af-code check-duplicate --content "<code>" OR --content-file /tmp/snippet.ts
  Before writing significant code, check for existing implementations to avoid duplication.

- pnpm af-code find-type-usages "<TypeName>" [--max-results 50]
  Find ALL switch/case statements, mapping objects, and usage sites for a union type or enum.
  CRITICAL: Use before adding new members to a type to identify every file needing updates.

- pnpm af-code validate-cross-deps [path]
  Check cross-package imports have package.json dependency declarations.

- pnpm af-code reserve-files <path1> <path2> [--reason "description"]
  Reserve files before editing to prevent merge conflicts with parallel agents.

All commands output JSON to stdout. First invocation builds the index (~5-10s); subsequent

HUMAN-NEEDED BLOCKERS:
If you encounter work that requires human action and cannot be resolved autonomously

manual setup steps, policy decisions, access permissions), use af_linear_create_blocker with
the source_issue_id and a title describing what the human needs to do.
