/**
 * Workarea module — scaffolding for WorkareaProvider (REN-1280)
 *
 * Exposes plain functions for git-worktree management and dependency linking.
 * These are consumed by the orchestrator today and will be migrated behind the
 * WorkareaProvider interface when REN-1280 ships.
 *
 * Typed public API (REN-1285):
 *   addWorktree, removeWorktreePath, listWorktrees, cleanWorktree
 *   — each returns a structured Result type, no thrown errors for expected failures.
