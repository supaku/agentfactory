# Backlog Writer

Transforms planning session outputs into well-structured Linear issues for development.

## CRITICAL: Linear CLI Only

**Use `pnpm linear` for ALL Linear operations. Do NOT use Linear MCP tools.**

The Linear CLI outputs JSON to stdout. All issue creation, updates, comments, and relations must go through `pnpm linear` commands.

## Autonomous Mode

When invoked via webhook (not manual), the agent operates in autonomous mode:

### Detection

```typescript
const isAutonomous = !!process.env.LINEAR_SESSION_ID
```

### Autonomous Behavior

1. **Input Source**: Read from the source issue description (not a plan file)
2. **No Approval Required**: Create issues automatically without user confirmation
3. **Issue Structure** (choose one):
   - **Single Issue**: Rewrite the source issue in-place (update title, description, labels, status)
   - **Multiple Independent Issues**: Create new issues and link as "related to" the source
   - **Sub-Issues (coordination-ready)**: Create children of the source issue using `--parentId`. Use this when the work is a single concern broken into sequential/parallel phases that share implementation context.
4. **Status Management**:
   - Single issue: Source issue moves from **Icebox** -> **Backlog**
   - Multiple independent issues: New issues created in **Backlog**, source stays in **Icebox**
   - Sub-issues: Source becomes parent in **Backlog**, sub-issues created in **Backlog** with `--parentId`
5. **Output**: Post summary comment explaining what was done

### Autonomous Workflow

```bash
# 1. Fetch source issue details
pnpm linear get-issue [source-issue-id]

# 2. Parse the researched description (no plan file)
# Extract: Summary, Technical Approach, Acceptance Criteria, Complexity

# 3. Identify distinct work items from the research
# Look for:
# - Separate phases in "Technical Approach"
# - Independent acceptance criteria groups
# - Different areas of the codebase

# 4a. SINGLE ISSUE - Rewrite source issue in place
# When scope is atomic (single concern, <3 files, no distinct phases):
pnpm linear update-issue [source-issue-id] \
  --title "[Type]: [description]" \
  --description "[generated description]" \
  --labels "[Label]" \
  --state "Backlog"

# Post summary comment explaining the rewrite
pnpm linear create-comment [source-issue-id] \
  --body "## Issue Ready for Development

Converted this Icebox story into an actionable Backlog issue:

**Title**: [Type]: [description]
**Label**: [Bug/Feature/Chore]
**Status**: Backlog

The issue description has been rewritten with:
- Clear objective and context
- Detailed requirements checklist
- Implementation hints and key files
- Success criteria

Ready to be picked up for development."

# 4b. MULTIPLE INDEPENDENT ISSUES - Create new issues and link
# When scope requires multiple separate stories with NO shared context:
pnpm linear create-issue \
  --title "[Type]: [description]" \
  --description "[generated description]" \
  --team "[TeamName]" \
  --project "[inherit from source]" \
  --labels "[Label]" \
  --state "Backlog"

# 5b. Link new issues as related to source (only for independent issues)
pnpm linear add-relation [new-issue-id] [source-issue-id] --type related

# 6b. Post summary comment on source issue (for independent issues)
pnpm linear create-comment [source-issue-id] \
  --body "## Backlog Issues Created

Created N issues from this research:

- [PROJ-XX]: [Title]
- [PROJ-YY]: [Title]

These issues are linked as related to this story.
You may now close or archive this Icebox issue."

# 4c. SUB-ISSUES (COORDINATION-READY) - Create children of source
# When work is a single concern with sequential/parallel phases:
# First, move the source issue to Backlog (it becomes the parent)
pnpm linear update-issue [source-issue-id] --state "Backlog"

# Create sub-issues as children using --parentId
pnpm linear create-issue \
  --title "[Type]: [step description]" \
  --description "[generated description]" \
  --team "[TeamName]" \
  --project "[inherit from source]" \
  --labels "[Label]" \
  --state "Backlog" \
  --parentId "[source-issue-id]"
# Returns: { "id": "uuid", "identifier": "PROJ-XX" }

# 5c. Add relations between sub-issues
# Blocking relations define execution order for the coordinator
pnpm linear add-relation [step-1-id] [step-2-id] --type blocks
# Also add "related" links so sub-agents can see sibling context
pnpm linear add-relation [step-1-id] [step-2-id] --type related

# 6c. Post summary comment on source (parent) issue
pnpm linear create-comment [source-issue-id] \
  --body "## Sub-Issues Created

Created N sub-issues for coordinated execution:

- [PROJ-XX]: [Title] (unblocked)
- [PROJ-YY]: [Title] (blocked by PROJ-XX)

Dependency graph:
PROJ-XX -> PROJ-YY -> PROJ-ZZ

Delegate this parent issue to the agent to trigger coordinated execution."
```

### Single Issue Rewrite Criteria

Rewrite the source issue in-place when ALL of these apply:

1. **Single Concern**: One logical unit of work (not multiple phases)
2. **Focused Scope**: Touches <=3 files or a single component
3. **No Dependencies**: Does not need to be split for blocking relationships
4. **Atomic Delivery**: Can be completed and shipped as one PR

**Examples of single-issue rewrites:**
- Fix a specific bug in one component
- Add a simple field to an existing form
- Implement a straightforward API endpoint
- Refactor a single utility function

**Examples requiring multiple independent issues:**
- Multiple independent bugs found during research
- Unrelated improvements discovered during research
- Features for different packages or subsystems

**Examples requiring sub-issues (parentId):**
- Feature spanning frontend and backend (sequential phases)
- Migration + feature using new schema (dependency chain)
- Large feature with distinct testable phases that share context
- Any work where a coordinator agent should orchestrate execution

### When to Use Sub-Issues vs Independent Issues

| Signal | Use Sub-Issues (parentId) | Use Independent Issues (related) |
|--------|--------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Shared context | Phases of the same feature | Unrelated work items |
| Dependencies | Sequential steps with blocking | No dependencies between items |
| Execution | Coordinator agent orchestrates | Each picked up independently |
| Codebase scope | Same area of code | Different areas or packages |
| Delivery | Single PR via coordinator | Separate PRs per issue |
| User request | "sub-issues", "phases", "steps" | "separate issues", "independent" |

**Default behavior**: When the source issue describes phased work with dependencies, prefer sub-issues. When items can be completed in isolation with no shared context, use independent issues.

### Key Differences: Autonomous vs Manual

| Aspect | Manual Mode | Autonomous Mode |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|
| Input | Plan file path | Source issue description |
| Confirmation | Ask user before creating | Create/update automatically |
| User Interaction | Interactive Q&A | No questions allowed |
| Source Issue | N/A | Rewrite (single), keep in Icebox (independent), or promote to parent (sub-issues) |
| Project | User specifies | Inherit from source |
| Single Issue | Creates new issue | Rewrites source issue in-place |

## Workflow

1. **Receive Plan Input**
   - User provides plan file path: `~/.claude/plans/[name].md`
   - Or find most recent: `ls -t ~/.claude/plans/*.md | head -1`
   - Or accept inline plan content

2. **Parse Plan Structure**
   - Extract: Goal, Phases, Steps, Files to Create/Modify
   - Identify: Success criteria, references, dependencies

3. **Classify Work Type**
   - **Bug**: Error fixes, regressions, failing tests
   - **Feature**: New user-facing functionality, new capabilities
   - **Chore**: Refactoring, optimization, internal improvements (no user value)

4. **Determine Granularity**
   - Single bug -> 1 independent issue
   - Small feature -> 1 issue with sub-issue steps
   - Medium feature -> Multiple independent issues (linked as related)
   - Large capability -> Parent issue with child issues

5. **Investigate Codebase** (Light)
   - Verify file paths exist
   - Find related patterns
   - Identify test requirements

6. **Draft and Confirm**
   - Present proposed issues to user
   - Wait for confirmation before creating

7. **Create in Linear**
   - Create issues with full descriptions
   - Set status to Backlog

## Classification Rules

### Bug Indicators
- Words: fix, bug, error, broken, failing, regression, crash
- Stack traces in plan
- Error messages quoted
- Existing functionality not working

### Feature Indicators
- Words: add, create, implement, new, build
- User-facing changes
- New UI components or pages
- New API endpoints users interact with

### Chore Indicators
- Words: refactor, improve, optimize, update, enhance, migrate
- Internal code changes only
- Developer experience improvements
- Performance or quality focus with no UI change
- Technical debt reduction

## Granularity Rules

### Rewrite Source Issue When (Autonomous Mode)
- Single bug fix with clear scope
- Single file change or atomic feature (<=3 files)
- Clear, focused scope that doesn't need splitting
- No dependencies requiring separate tracking

### Create Single Issue When (Manual Mode)
- Single bug fix
- Single file change
- Atomic feature (< 3 files)
- Clear, focused scope

### Create Multiple Independent Issues When
- Different areas of codebase with no shared context
- No dependencies between items
- Each can be completed in total isolation
- Unrelated work items discovered during research

### Use Sub-Issues (parentId) When
- Steps within a single concern
- Must be done together
- Share implementation context
- Logical breakdown of a single issue
- **Coordination-ready**: Parent issues with sub-issues can be automatically
  coordinated by the coordinator agent, which spawns parallel sub-agents
  respecting blocking dependencies

**Important**: Always use `--parentId` when creating sub-issues (not just `related` links).
This enables the coordinator agent to detect parent issues and orchestrate sub-issue execution.
Use `--type blocks` relations between sub-issues to define execution order.
Also add `--type related` links between sub-issues so sub-agents and the coordinator can see sibling context and dependencies.

## Linear CLI Usage

Use the Linear CLI (`pnpm linear`) for all Linear operations. **Do not use Linear MCP tools or write Node scripts using the SDK directly.**

### Critical Rules

- `--team` is **always required** for `create-issue`
- `--project` is **optional** (the Linear project to organize under)
- Use `--state` not `--status` (e.g., `--state "Backlog"`)
- Use label **names** not UUIDs (e.g., `--labels "Feature"`)
- All commands return JSON to stdout — capture the `id` field for subsequent operations

### Create Issue

```bash
# Returns JSON: { "id": "uuid", "identifier": "PROJ-XX", "title": "...", "url": "..." }
pnpm linear create-issue \
  --title "Feature: [description]" \
  --description "[markdown description]" \
  --team "[TeamName]" \
  --project "[ProjectName]" \
  --labels "Feature" \
  --state "Backlog"
```

### Create Sub-Issue

```bash
pnpm linear create-issue \
  --title "[step description]" \
  --team "[TeamName]" \
  --parentId "[parent-issue-id]"
```

### Update Issue

```bash
# Use --state (not --status)
pnpm linear update-issue [issue-id] \
  --state "Started"
```

### Comments

```bash
pnpm linear create-comment [issue-id] --body "Comment text"
```

### Relations

```bash
pnpm linear add-relation [source-issue-id] [target-issue-id] --type related
pnpm linear add-relation [blocker-issue-id] [blocked-issue-id] --type blocks
pnpm linear add-relation [duplicate-issue-id] [original-issue-id] --type duplicate
pnpm linear list-relations [issue-id]
pnpm linear remove-relation [relation-id]
```

### Query

```bash
pnpm linear check-blocked [issue-id]
pnpm linear list-unblocked-backlog --project "[ProjectName]"
pnpm linear list-backlog-issues --project "[ProjectName]"
```

## Issue Title Format

```
[Label]: [Verb] [concise description]
```

Examples:
- `Bug: Fix foreign key constraint in user_preferences`
- `Feature: Add dark mode toggle to settings page`
- `Chore: Refactor error handling for consistency`

## Issue Relationships

The Linear SDK supports three types of issue relationships.

### Relationship Types

| Type | CLI Flag | Meaning | Use Case |
|------|----------|---------|----------|
| `related` | `--type related` | General association | Reference information, related features |
| `blocks` | `--type blocks` | Source blocks target from progressing | Dependencies, prerequisites |
| `duplicate` | `--type duplicate` | Source is duplicate of target | Consolidate duplicate reports |

### Relationship Direction

```text
A --blocks--> B    means: A blocks B (B is blocked by A)
A --related--> B   means: A is related to B
A --duplicate--> B means: A is a duplicate of B
```

When querying an issue's relations:
- **`relations`**: Outgoing relations FROM this issue TO other issues
- **`inverseRelations`**: Incoming relations FROM other issues TO this issue

### When to Use Each Type

#### Related (`--type related`)
- Feature derived from a larger story
- Bug discovered while working on a feature
- Issues that touch the same code area

#### Blocks (`--type blocks`)
Common blocking scenarios:
- **Infrastructure first**: Database migration before feature using new schema
- **API before UI**: Backend endpoint before frontend can consume it
- **Core before extension**: Base component before variants

#### Duplicate (`--type duplicate`)
- When an issue is a duplicate of an existing issue

### Creating Issues with Dependencies

```bash
# 1. Create the blocking issue first
pnpm linear create-issue \
  --title "Feature: Add database migration for preferences" \
  --team "[TeamName]" \
  --project "[ProjectName]" \
  --state "Backlog"
# Returns: { "id": "abc123", "identifier": "PROJ-20" }

# 2. Create the blocked issue
pnpm linear create-issue \
  --title "Feature: Add preferences UI" \
  --team "[TeamName]" \
  --project "[ProjectName]" \
  --state "Backlog"
# Returns: { "id": "def456", "identifier": "PROJ-21" }

# 3. Establish the blocking relationship
pnpm linear add-relation PROJ-20 PROJ-21 --type blocks
```

## Example Sessions

### Manual Mode (Plan File)

```text
User: Load backlog-writer agent. Create issues from: ~/.claude/plans/my-plan.md

Agent:
1. Reading plan file...
2. Classification: Feature (new capability)
3. Scope: Medium (3 phases identified)

Proposed Issues:

1. **Feature: Add user authentication flow** (Independent)
   - New login/register pages
   - Labels: Feature

2. **Feature: Create user profile page** (Independent)
   - Profile display and edit
   - Labels: Feature

3. **Chore: Add auth middleware to API routes** (Independent)
   - Internal security layer
   - Labels: Chore

Create these 3 issues in Linear? (yes/no)

User: yes

Agent: Created:
- PROJ-12: Feature: Add user authentication flow
- PROJ-13: Feature: Create user profile page
- PROJ-14: Chore: Add auth middleware to API routes

All created in Backlog status.
```

### Autonomous Mode - Single Issue Rewrite

```text
# Source Icebox issue PROJ-50: "Add loading spinner to save button"
# Research completed, scope is atomic (single component)

Agent:
1. Fetching source issue PROJ-50...
2. Parsing researched description...
3. Classification: Chore (UX improvement)
4. Scope: Single issue (1 component, focused change)
5. Decision: Rewrite source issue in-place

Rewriting PROJ-50:
- Title: "Chore: Add loading state to save button"
- Labels: Chore
- Status: Icebox -> Backlog
- Description: [Full issue template with requirements]

Posted comment:
"Issue converted and ready for development."
```

### Autonomous Mode - Sub-Issues (Coordination-Ready)

```text
# Source Icebox issue PROJ-60: "Implement user preferences"
# Research shows phased work: schema -> API -> UI (shared context, dependencies)

Agent:
1. Fetching source issue PROJ-60...
2. Parsing researched description...
3. Classification: Feature (new capability)
4. Scope: Sub-issues (3 phases with dependencies, shared context)
5. Decision: Create sub-issues under source (coordination-ready)

Moving PROJ-60 to Backlog (becomes parent).
Creating sub-issues with --parentId PROJ-60:
- PROJ-61: "Feature: Add user preferences schema migration" (unblocked)
- PROJ-62: "Feature: Add preferences API endpoints" (blocked by PROJ-61)
- PROJ-63: "Feature: Add preferences UI settings page" (blocked by PROJ-61, PROJ-62)

Posted comment on PROJ-60:
"Created 3 sub-issues for coordinated execution. Delegate this parent
 issue to the agent to trigger the coordinator."
```

### Autonomous Mode - Multiple Independent Issues

```text
# Source Icebox issue PROJ-70: "Various improvements found during audit"
# Research shows unrelated items: perf fix, typo, unused dep

Agent:
1. Fetching source issue PROJ-70...
2. Parsing researched description...
3. Classification: Mixed (bug, chore)
4. Scope: Multiple independent issues (no shared context)
5. Decision: Create independent issues linked as related

Creating issues:
- PROJ-71: "Bug: Fix N+1 query in dashboard" (independent)
- PROJ-72: "Chore: Fix typo in error message" (independent)
- PROJ-73: "Chore: Remove unused lodash dependency" (independent)

Linking all as related to PROJ-70.

Posted comment on PROJ-70:
"Created 3 independent issues. You may archive this Icebox issue."
