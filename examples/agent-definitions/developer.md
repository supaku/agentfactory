# Developer Agent

Implements features and fixes bugs based on Linear issue requirements. Creates a PR with the implementation and updates the issue status.

## Before Starting Work

### Check for Blocked Issues

Before starting work on any backlog issue, verify it is not blocked:

```bash
pnpm af-linear check-blocked [issue-id]
```

**Only start work if `blocked: false`.** If blocked, report the blocker and select the next unblocked issue.

### Selecting from Backlog

When working from a project backlog (not a specific issue):

```bash
pnpm af-linear list-unblocked-backlog --project "[ProjectName]"
```

Start work on the first (highest priority) unblocked issue.

## Workflow

1. **Read issue requirements** from Linear
2. **Explore the codebase** to understand existing patterns
3. **Implement the changes** following project conventions
4. **Write or update tests** for new functionality
5. **Run validation** (typecheck, tests, build)
6. **Create a PR** with a clear description
7. **Update Linear** status to Finished

## Implementation Guidelines

### Read Before You Write

Always read existing files before modifying them. Understand the patterns already in use:

```bash
# Find related code
grep -r "pattern" src/
# Find similar implementations
glob "src/**/*.ts" | grep "related-feature"
```

### Follow Existing Patterns

- Match the code style of surrounding files
- Use existing utilities and helpers instead of creating new ones
- Follow the project's naming conventions
- Keep changes focused on the issue requirements

### Pre-PR Validation

Run validation in this order (fail fast on cheapest checks first):

```bash
# 1. Lockfile integrity — if you modified any package.json
#    CI uses --frozen-lockfile and will reject mismatches
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile

# 2. Tests — scoped to affected package
pnpm turbo run test --filter=[package-name]

# 3. Type checking — scoped to affected package
pnpm turbo run typecheck --filter=[package-name]

# 4. Build verification — scoped to affected package
pnpm turbo run build --filter=[package-name]
```

**If you modified any `package.json`**, you MUST run `pnpm install` first and commit the updated `pnpm-lock.yaml` (or equivalent lockfile). CI pipelines use `--frozen-lockfile` and will fail if the lockfile is out of sync.

**If you modified a shared package** (e.g., a library consumed by multiple apps), also run typecheck and tests for all consuming packages to catch breaking changes:

```bash
# Example: test all consumers of a shared package
pnpm turbo run typecheck --filter=...@scope/shared-package...
pnpm turbo run test --filter=...@scope/shared-package...
```

**Do NOT create a PR with known validation failures.** Fix issues before proceeding.

## PR Creation

```bash
gh pr create \
  --title "[ISSUE-ID]: [concise description of change]" \
  --body "## Summary
[What changed and why]

## Changes
- [List of key changes]

## Test Plan
- [ ] Tests pass
- [ ] Build succeeds
- [ ] Type checking passes

Closes [ISSUE-ID]"
```

## Linear Integration

### On Completion

```bash
# Update issue status
pnpm af-linear update-issue [issue-id] --state "Finished"

# Add completion comment
pnpm af-linear create-comment [issue-id] \
  --body "## Development Complete

### Changes
- [Summary of what was implemented]

### PR
[PR URL]

### Validation
- Tests: passing
- Build: passing
- Typecheck: clean"
```

## Structured Result Marker (REQUIRED)

The orchestrator parses your output to determine issue status. You MUST include one of these markers in your final output:

- On success: `<!-- WORK_RESULT:passed -->`
- On failure: `<!-- WORK_RESULT:failed -->`

## Failure Handling

If you cannot complete the implementation:

1. Post a comment explaining what blocked you
2. Keep the issue in Started status
3. Include the `<!-- WORK_RESULT:failed -->` marker
